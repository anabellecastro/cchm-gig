         <p>Tom Andersen specializes in video production and digital content creation.</p>
         <p>He went through each interview to identify which gave the best explanations of the CCHM’s mission. To support each interview, he had planned to film specific exhibits, however the museum had closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, he added B-roll from social media sources in addition to the museum’s photographic archive, and the team produced great videos with the help of the museum’s resources.</p>

         <p>She collaborated with the team to create the concept behind their videos and shoot interviews with the staff at CCHM. She worked with the lighting of the videos, as well as conducting interview questions. Though the team wasn’t able to film B-roll to pair with their interviews due to the COVID-19 pandemic, through creativity and the help of the museum’s archives, they produced some great videos.</p>

      <h1>About</h1>
      <div class="home-contain">
        <p>The Video Team created videos that told the story of the Clark County Historical Museum. Each video illustrates the importance of the Clark County Historical Museum, and the spirit of the staff and volunteers that personify the museum’s mission of “Gather, Save, Share.”</p>
          <p>
          The making of these videos was hindered because of the cancellation of face-to-face meetings in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a team, they strategically planned the incorporation of existing resources to tell the story of the CCHM. What they produced perfectly captured the essence of the CCHM and its role as an invaluable resource for the Clark County community.
